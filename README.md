# Sleek App Portfolio Website
A custom-coded portfolio website for **Sleek App** Dev Agency. The frontend is written with **React** and **Typescript** and the backend is written with **Node.js** and **Typescript**.


## Commands

Follow these steps one by one and the jobs will run successfully.

 1. Run **yarn installation** and the dependencies in both the frontend and backend will install.
 2. Run **yarn start:dev** and the backend and frontend will both start. Caveat: **PORT 8000** and **PORT 3000** need to be open.
 3. Run **yarn production** and both the frontend and backend will build production-ready bundles. Upload these files to a hosting provider to deploy the projects.
